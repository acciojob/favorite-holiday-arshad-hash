	<h1>Maldives</h1><br>
	<p>The Maldives has been
		inhabited for over 2,500 years.
		In the 12th century Islam reached
		the Maldivian Archipelago, which was
		consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong
		commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa
		From the mid-16th century, the region came under the
		increasing influence of European colonial powers, with
		the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887.
		Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and 
		a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an
		elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen
		political instability, efforts at democratic reform,[13] 
		and environmental 
		challenges posed by climate change and rising sea
		levels.[14]</p>
